I know this is kind of cheating/fake, but it's better than nothing right?
Because no matter how hard you look, you are unable to find a Windows version anywhere. So to all of you "MacOS-fanboys" out there (such as myself ðŸ˜‚), here you go.

*P.S. I will try build a legitimate version that utilises the hardware instead of using a 10 minute looping video, so be on the look out for that!*
