MacOS Drift Screensaver for Windows

**(Both need to be downloaded in order for it to work!)**
 - [Download Video (Front-End)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v-ZUKdi9c3nTF5sbVGZGU8L0wuRlCs7z/view)
 - [Download Screen Saver (Back-End)](https://github.com/y2k04/windrift/raw/main/VideoScreensaver.scr)

I know this is kind of cheating/fake, but it's better than nothing right?
Because no matter how hard you look, you are unable to find a Windows version anywhere. So to all of you "MacOS-fanboys" out there (such as myself ðŸ˜‚), here you go.

*P.S. I will try build a legitimate version that utilises the hardware instead of using a 10 minute looping video, so be on the look out for that!*

## Setup Instructions
1. Download the mp4 video and the scr file from above.
2. In File Explorer, right click "VideoScreensaver.scr" and press Install.
3. In the window that opens after that, press the Settings button. That will open a file select dialog.
4. Find the video that you just downloaded and select it.

You may modify the length of time until the screen saver activates as you wish. And for you laptop users, no it does not affect battery life.

Enjoy!
